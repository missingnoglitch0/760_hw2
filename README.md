# CS760 Homework 2

## 1 A Simplified Decision Tree

code found in: `decision_tree.py`

To run the code for this problem, type `python3 decision_tree.py <filepath>`, where `<filepath>` is the path of the file that you wish to run through the learning algorithm.

When finished, the program should output a depiction of the decision tree and will then prompt the user for new data points to classify according to that tree.

The main components of the decision tree logic implementation can be found in sections which begin and end with `###` followed by one of the 3 main components mentioned in question @48 on Piazza.
